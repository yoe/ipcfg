Description: Network configuration system
 ipcfg is a modern, flexible network configuration system, by its
 authors intended to eventually replace ifupdown as the default network
 configuration management system in Debian.
 .
 Although it is not yet ready, it can already be used for fairly simple
 network configuration tasks: a desktop with a fixed or DHCP-assigned IP
 address, a laptop with a wireless interface, and others.
 .
 Even though it is incomplete, it already has a few features not found
 in ifupdown: e.g., it can decide which interface to bring up at boot
 time based on whether a link is available on a list of interfaces, and
 it can change inteface names halfway through an 'ifup' run (allowing
 things like 'ifup any-network').
